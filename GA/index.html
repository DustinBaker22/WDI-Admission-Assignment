				<p>First and foremost, I would like to thank General Assembly for taking the time to give me the opportunity to showcase some of what I can do. The possibility of joining a coding boot camp, in order to jump start my new career within the Web Development community is very exciting, and I honestly cannot wait to dive-in head first. I truly appreciate you giving me this opportunity.</p>
 
				<p>As you already know, my name is Dustin Baker. I am originally from Miami, Florida, and am presently living in San Antonio, Texas. I am 36 years young and I have a 10 year old son who is my world. I am a licensed massage therapist for the state of Texas.  The art of computing has been a passion of mine for many years; however, the need to provide for my family made this desire take a back seat in my life.  I seized every opportunity I could find to read and learn about developing websites.  I taught myself flash and succeeded in building my own photography website.  A friend of mine, who works for <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/author/michaelwales">Udacity</a>, was the person who brought web development to my attention.  He opened my eyes to this field and has been helping me understand about web development.</p>
				
				<p>Ever since I decided to look into Web Development, I have really immersed myself within the WebDev community in order to reach my goal to become not only just a front-end or back-end web developer, but a <b>FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER</b>! At 36 years of age, I am finally finding what it is that I want to do for a living. Sadly, it has taken me this long to actually listen to all of my friends and family about doing something with computers. I have always been the type of person who had the instinct to fix computers. Whether it is software or hardware based, I am very good at fixing any issue that I come across; and, if I cannot seem to fix it, then Google to the rescue it is!</p>
				 
				<p>Five months ago, I decided to start looking into web development. I started with <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Tree House</a> but then a friend of mine, who was also studying web development, told me about <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. I decided to enroll into Thinkful's 3 month Front-End Web Development course. The course covered <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JQuery</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, and <b>AJAX</b>. Once I was enrolled, I was assigned a mentor that I was only allowed to talk with once a week for only 30 minutes at a time. For me, HTML and CSS was a breeze; however, once I got into JQuery, I found that I needed to get assistance from a mentor.  I found it a bit frustrating to only have access to mentoring 30 minutes per week.  It is not that I want, or expect anyone to “hold my hand” through any of this process because I am not going to be able to learn that way; however, I would like to have someone who can help me when I am in need of an answer to a question that I am having, and not have to wait in order to keep moving forward. This is the main reason why I would like to join a coding boot camp. I believe that being in a classroom setting, surrounded by instructors who know how the code actually works, as well as being surrounded by likeminded individuals going through the same issues and projects that I am, is definitely the most conducive way to learn how to code.</p>
				 
				<p>Last month, I joined a great place called <a href="http://www.geekdom.com/san-antonio">Geekdom</a>. Prior to joining, I attended a lot of meetings (meetups) on web development, many that were based at the Geekdom headquarters here in San Antonio. I decided that it would be a great place to go to do my school work, as well as a great place to network. It has totally paid off!  I have been able to work on my Javascript coding through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> as well as network with other likeminded individuals, and the meetups are right there. It has been a great experience, to say the least, and I can only imagine what San Francisco holds for the web development community. I am very excited!</p>
				 
				<p>I sincerely hope that I have communicated how extremely serious I am about making this career change and that this is a goal that I am willing to put forth more than just three months effort towards. If there is one thing that excites me about web development is that it is forever changing. I will always be learning because being bored with doing the same thing over and over is definitely not part of this career. I am looking for a <b>D.R.Y.</b><i> (Don't Repeat Yourself)</i> type of career. I appreciate your time, and patience, reading this and taking the time to talk with me. I hope to be able to have the opportunity to become an alumni of General Assembly!</p>
